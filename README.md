# pipeline_scheduler
Streamlit app to automate pipeline job schedules. At present, this is a work in progress (WIP).

## Purpose
This is less of an application/report and more of an app that leverages the autorefresh functionality of Streamlit to create an easily modifiable data pipeline job scheduler.

The user should modify the config.json to add new projects and job schedules.

From there, they can select the project that they want to view and see the current status of jobs running. Future versions will incorporate the ability to view full log histories.
